    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
        Vaishali, Pali Vesali, city of ancient India, north of Patna, northwestern Bihar state, on the Gandak River. In antiquity Vaishali was the capital of the Licchavi republic and was closely associated with the early histories of both Buddhism and Jainism. Roads connected it with Rajagriha to the south and Kapilavastu and Shravasti to the north. Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, was born in Vaishali and spent much time there. The Buddha also visited the city on many occasions. Its several important monasteries and shrines were described by the Chinese pilgrim Faxian in the 5th century CE. After the death of the Buddha (c. 483 BCE), the second great council of Buddhists was held at Vaishali to provide rules of conduct.

    <h1>Ancient </h1>
    <p>
        According to tradition, the city in early times was surrounded by three walls with gates and watchtowers. The site today is marked by two groups of mounds and has been partly excavated by archaeologists. The earliest occupation of the site is associated with black-and-red pottery of probably pre-Buddhist age; it was followed by the northern black polished ware of early Buddhist times. Vaishali is on the site of a village now known as Besarh.

He is mentioned as a staunch follower of Jainism.[14] According to the text, Chetaka had ten sons and seven daughters. His sister Priyakarini (also known as Trishala) was married to Siddhartha.[14] His daughter Chellana married Shrenik (also known as Bimbisara).[15] As per Indologist Hermann Jacobi, Vardhaman Mahavira's mother Trishala was sister of King Chetaka.[16] Vaiśālī was also the residence of Kandaramasuka and Pātikaputta.

    <h1>Relic stupa</h1>
    <p>
        
        Near the coronation tank is Stupa 1 or the Relic Stupa. Here the Licchavis reverentially encased one of the eight portions of the Master's relics, which they received after the Mahaparinirvana. After his last discourse the Buddha set out for Kushinagar, but the Licchavis kept following him. The Buddha gave them his alms bowl but they still refused to return. He then created an illusion of a river in spate which compelled them to go back. This site can be identified with Deora in modern Kesariya village, where Ashoka later built a stupa.[17]

As per recent research, the relic stupa is potentially one of the earliest archaeologically known stupas.[18]
